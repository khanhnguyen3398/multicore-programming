I made a Makefile and we looked at it after class on Tuesday 
June 11 and made some changes to it. I'm not sure why I was
getting linker errors that I didn't know how to fix.
I tried to manually compile it using this command and it worked:

g++ -o multimap main.cpp
./multimap

Please use the above command to compile my code. I'm so sorry
about the inconvenience, I know you prefer a Makefile or a build.sh.

For my data structure, I created a multimap class with a vector of keys
and a vector of vectors of values for the corresponding key. 
For example, the first key in the keys vector corresponds to the 
first vector of values in the value vector.
